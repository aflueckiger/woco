# Word Continuum Explorer (WoCo)
The Word Continuum Explorer (WoCo) is a web application designed to compare the
most common contexts of a group of words. The application was originally intended to
compare semantically similar words but is not restricted to that singular use. It is possible to
compare near synonyms (i.e. run/jog), antonyms (i.e. fast/slow) and much more.
The parameter settings allow customization according to the users needs. The results
comprise a visualization of the most common syntactic neighbours on either side of each
word and a sankey diagramm depicting the most relevant context words lor the entire
group of words.
